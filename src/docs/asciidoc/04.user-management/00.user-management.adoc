= User Management

In the context of the Common Architecture, User Management covers the following main functional areas:

Identity and Access Management (IAM)::
Identification/authentication of users and authorization of access to protected resources (data/services) within the EP.

Accounting and Billing::
Maintaining an accounting record of all user accesses to data/services/applications, supported by appropriate systems of credits and billing.

User Profile::
Maintenance of details associated to the user that may be needed in support of access management and billing.

These are explored in the following sub-sections.

[[IAM,Identity and Access Management]]
== Identity and Access Management (IAM)

The goal of IAM is to uniquely identify the user and limit access to protected resources to those having suitable access rights. We assume an Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) approach in which authorisation decisions are made based upon access policies/rules that define attributes required by resources and possessed (as claims) by users. ABAC is is seen as a more flexible approach than Role Base Access Control (RBAC), affording the ability to express more sofisticated authorisations rules beyond the role(s) of the user - and noting the fact that a role-based ruleset could be implemented within an attribute based approach, (i.e. RBAC is a subset/specialisation of ABAC).

In achieving this there are three main concerns:

* Unique user identification
* Determine the access policy applicable to the resource
* From the access policy determine:
** what attributes are required to access the protected resource
** whether the user has the required attributes

For the Common Architecture, we establish separation of User Identification from Access Management. User identity is federated and handled external to the platform. Within the Network of EO Resources, resources held within an exploitation platform are made available to federated partner platforms. Authorisation policy is enforced within the platform at point of access, but the access policy can be federated within the network of EO resources, leading to a system of _federated authorisation_.

* The identity is provided externally. The external IdP has no association to the exploitation platform, and hence is not the appropriate place to administer attributes that relate to EP resources
* The protected resources are under the custodianship of the exploitation platform and hence the exploitation platform enforces the access policy decision
* The administrative domain for an access policy should should not be tied to an exploitation platform, which facilitates the provision of federation and virtual organisations

=== IAM Approach

<<img_iamOverview>> presents the basic approach. At this stage it does not consider the case in which an exploitation platform accesses resources in another platform on behalf of a user, (for example a workflow step that is invoked on another platform). This is addressed in a later section. Users are authenticated by redirection to an external identity provider, (their ‘home’ IdP). This returns the authentication decision and some basic user information as required (such as name, email, etc.).

[#img_iamOverview,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Identity and Access Management Overview

Each protected resource is fronted by its Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), which acts as filter that will only permit access if the appropriate conditions are met. This decision is made according to a set of rules that are under the control of and configured within the exploitation platform.

The Login Service is provided as a common component that is utilised by each PEP to perform the authentication flow with the external IdPs. In the case of an unauthenticated request that requires authentication, the PEP will initiate the Login Service by redirection of the User’s originating request. The successful flow ultimately redirects back to the PEP and so maintains the direct connection between the end-user agent and the resource server. An alternative approach would be the use of an API Gateway to perform the role of the PEP, acting as an intermediary between the end-user agent and the resource server. However, this would have the effect of proxying the connection which can have an impact on data transfer performance, which is of particular importance in the case of significant data volumes being returned to the User.

The PEP interrogates the PDP for an authorisation decision. The PEP sends a request that indicates the pertinent details of the attempted access, including:

* Identity of end-user (subject)
* The API (path/version etc.) being accessed (resource)
* The operation (HTTP verb) being performed (action)

The Policy Decision Point (PDP) returns an authorisation decision based upon details provided in the request, and the applicable authorisation policy. The authorisation policy may delegate all or part of the decision to external PDP(s) within the federated network. This represents a Federated Authorisation model and facilitates a model of shared resources and virtual organisations.

The authorisation policy defines a set of rules and how they should be evaluated to determine the policy decision. The rules are expressed through attributes. The policy is evaluated to determine what attributes are required, and what attributes the user possesses. This evaluation extends through external PDPs according to any federated authorisation defined in the policy.

It should be additionally noted that the decision to allow the user access depends upon dynamic 'attributes', such as whether the user has enough credits to 'pay' for their usage, or whether they have accepted the necessary Terms & Conditions for a given dataset or service. Thus, the PDP must interrogate other EP-services such as 'Accounting & Billing' and 'User Profile' to answer such questions.

<<img_iamOverviewFlow>> provides an overview of the IAM Flow.

Note that the interface between the Login Service and the External IdPs is simplified in this view. It is expanded in later sections.

=== IAM Top-level Interfaces

<<img_iamInterfaces>> illustrates the interfaces of the IAM architecture.

[#img_iamInterfaces,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.IAM Interfaces
image::iam-interfaces.png[width=1000,align="center"]

User -> Protected Resource::
The Protected Resource exposes a public API for user consumption.

Protected Resource -> PEP::
The PEP acts as a filter on the access request to the resource. The PEP intercepts the incoming request in order to enforce the authorisation policy decision.

PEP -> Login Service::
The PEP uses a redirect to delegate the authentication flow to the Login Service.

Login Service -> External IdP::
In order to support multiple external identity suppliers, the Login Service must act as a client to multiple external IdPs, and so must establish individual trust relationships with each of these. Alternatively, the Login Service can instead interface to a single external IdP Proxy, that interfaces to the external IdPs on behalf of the EP. The IdP Proxy can provide this service to multiple EPs.

PEP -> PDP::
Request carries the user identification, the URI of the resource, and the action.
Response returns the authorisation decision.

PDP -> Other PDP::
Same interface characteristics as PEP->PDP.

== Authenticated Identity

The approach to user identity and authentication centres around the use of OpenID Connect. Each Exploitation Platform maintains their own OIDC Provider through which tokens can be issued to permit access to protected resources within the EP. The authentication itself is delegated to external Identity Providers at the preference of the end-user wishing to reuse their existing identity provision.

=== Overview

The Login Service is an OpenID Connect Provider that provides a ‘Login With’ service that allows the platform to support multiple external identity providers. The Login Service acts as a Relying Party in its interactions with the external IdPs to establish the authenticated identity of the user through delegated authentication.

The Login Service presents an OIDC Provider interface to its clients, through which the OIDC clients can obtain Access Tokens to resources. The access tokens are presented by the clients in their requests to resource servers (intercepted by PEP). The PEP (acting on behalf of the resource server) relies upon the access token to establish the authenticated identity of the users making the requests. Once the user identity is established, then the PEP can continue with its policy decision (deferred to the PDP).

Thus, clients of the EP must act as OIDC Clients in order to authenticate their users to the platform, before invoking its services. Clients include the web applications that provide the UI of the exploitation platform, as well as other external applications/systems (including other exploitation platforms) wishing to use the services of the EP.

The Login Service must act as client (Relying Party) to each of the External IdPs to be supported and offered as a ‘Login With’ option. The interface/flow with the External IdP is integrated into the OIDC flow implemented by the Login Service. This includes prompting the user to discover their ‘home’ Identity provider. The interactions with the external IdP represents the ‘user authentication step’ within the OIDC flows. Completion of a successful authentication with the external IdP allows the Login Service to issue the requested access tokens (depending on the flow used).

<<img_iamAuthenticationFlow>> illustrates the basic user access flow, invoked through a web browser.

=== Login Service

The Login Service is an OIDC Provider that provides a ‘Login With’ service that allows the end-user to select their Identity Provider for purposes of authentication.

The Login Service is designed to support the onward forwarding of the authentication request through external identity services, which should be expected to include:

* EduGain
* GitHub
* Google
* Twitter
* Facebook
* LinkedIn
* Others TBD

The Login Service must establish itself as a client (Relying Party) of all supported external IdPs, with appropriate trust relationships and support for their authentication flows.

The primary endpoints required to support the OIDC flows are as follows (these endpoints are taken, by example, from OKTA OIDC discovery metadata, https://micah.okta.com/oauth2/aus2yrcz7aMrmDAKZ1t7/.well-known/openid-configuration):

authorization_endpoint (/authorize)::
To initiate the authentication, and to return the access tokens / code grant (depending on flow).

token_endpoint (/token)::
To exchange the code grant for the access tokens.

userinfo_endpoint (/userinfo)::
To obtain the user information ID token in accordance with the scopes requested in the authorisation request.

jwks_uri (/keys)::
To obtain signing keys for Token validation purposes.

end_session_endpoint (/logout)::
To logout the user from the Login Service, i.e. clear session cookies etc. Although, given that the actual IdP is externalised from the Login Service, it would remain the case that any session cookies maintained by the external IdP would still be in place for a future authentication flow.

introspection_endpoint (/introspect)::
Used by clients to verify access tokens.

revocation_endpoint (/revoke)::
Used for (refresh) token revocation.

As described in section ‘Discovery’, the following endpoints relate to Discovery:

OIDC Discovery (/.well-known/openid-configuration)::
Dynamic discovery of OIDC endpoints by clients.

As described in section ‘Client Registration’, the following endpoints relate to Dynamic Client Registration:

registration_endpoint (/clients)::
Dynamic registration of clients (Authentication Agents).

As described in section ‘Federation’, the following endpoints relate to the establishment of a federation of collaborating Exploitation Platforms through a dynamic trust model:

/.well-known/openid-federation::
OIDC Federation API endpoint through which Entity Statements are published about itself and other entities (such as other Exploitation Platforms). See section ‘Federation’.

=== OIDC ID Token

The ID Token is a JWT that is returned to from the /userinfo endpoint of the Login Service. The returned OIDC ID Token has been signed (JWS) by the Login Service and thus results in a token that asserts a user’s authenticated identity with integrity, and non-repudiation.

=== OIDC Clients

Clients are Relying Parties that act on behalf of users accessing the services of the Exploitation Platform. They will either pre-emptively obtain their access token for required resources, or will attempt resource access and be redirected by exception to the OIDC Provider authentication flow.

In the case of a web application (browser hosted), the Implicit Flow would be used. In other cases (TBD) the Authorisation Code Flow would be preferred.

The OIDC flows are initiated with the appropriate response_type (‘id_token token’ for Implicit Flow, ‘code’ for Authorisation Code Flow) and scope of ‘oidc profile’.

At the successful conclusion of the flow the client receives the Access Token and ID Token. The Access Token is then used by the client as a Bearer token in its subsequent calls to access the EP resources.

=== PEP (Resource Server filter)

The PEP (acting on behalf of the resource server) receives the client request to access the protected resource. In the case that the access requires an authenticated user, then the PEP expects that the request includes a valid access token.

Thus, the PEP follows the logic:

* The PEP checks with the PDP whether an authenticated user is required for access
* If no authenticated user is required then the request can continue (pending authorisation) as an 'anonymous' user
* If access requires an authenticated user then
** If the access token is not present then no user is logged in, so the request should be redirected to the /authorize endpoint (HTTP redirect)
** If the access token is present, then it should be validated with the Login Service (direct call), as described below
** If the access token validation completes successfully then the request can continue (pending authorisation), with the user identity provided by the ID Token received during token validation
** If the token is invalid, then the request should be redirected to the /authorize endpoint (HTTP redirect)

=== Access Token Validation

The PEP validates the access token by using it as a Bearer token in a request to the Login Service’s /userinfo endpoint. A successful response has two outcomes:

* Confirms the validity of the access token from the point-of-view of the Login Service that issued it
* Provides an ID Token for the user that provides the information required to uniquely identify the user within the EP and utilise this identity within the subsequent policy decision made by the PDP

The ID Token is a JWT that has been signed by the Login Service. Using the jwks (see section ‘OIDC Federation’) endpoint of the Login Service, the PEP is able to obtain the necessary keys to validate the signature of the ID Token. This provides the full user context for the resource access.

=== Federated User Access

Based upon the above authentication model, an EP could access the resources of another EP by obtaining an access token through OIDC flows. However, considering that these EP->EP invocations will typically be Machine-to-machine (M2M), then we need to consider how the end-user (resource owner) is able to compete their consent. Two possibilities are explored in the subsequent sections:

. The user pre-authorises the EP->EP access in advance of the operation
. Use of OIDC JWKS for trusted federation of identity between platforms

==== User Pre-authorisation

Using the facilities of the Exploitation Platform, the user (perhaps via their User Profile management console) initiates the authorisation flow from one EP to another. The end result is that the originating EP obtains delegated access to another EP on behalf of the user - with the resulting access tokens being maintained within the user's profile on the EP.

At the point where the EP needs to access a resource on another EP, then the access tokens are obtained from the user's profile and used as Bearer token in the resource request to the other EP. Refresh tokens can be used to ensure that authorisation is long-lived.

Conversly, the user's profile at a given EP should also provide the ability to manage any inward authrosations they have granted to other EPs, i.e. ability to revoke a previous authorisation by invalidating the refresh token. This would invole interface with the Login Service.

==== Possible use of OIDC JWKS Federation

OIDC provides a distributed key-hierarchy that could be used to support federated user access between collaborating exploitation platforms. The concept is explored in this section.

Reference: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html

OIDC provides a framework in which RPs and OPs can dynamically establish verifiable trust chains, and so share keys to support signing and validation of JWTs.

Dedicated ‘federation’ endpoints are defined that allow an entity (such as RP or OP) to publish their own Entity Statements, and to obtain Statements for other entities that are issued by trusted third-parties within the federation. The metadata/signatures within the Entity Statements establish a chain of trust that can be followed to known (trusted) Trust Anchors, and so the Entity Statements and the included entity public keys can be trusted.

Thus, through this mechanism public keys can be shared to underpin the signing and validation of JWTs.

Within an EP, when a resource server is executing a user’s request, it may need to invoke a resource in another EP with which it is collaborating. The resource access to the other EP must be made on behalf of the originating user.

The nominal solution is for the originating EP to act as an OIDC Client to interface with the Login Service of the other EP, and so obtain the access token required to access the other resource. In this case, we should consider the fact that the resource access may be asynchronous to the end-user request and is not made within the context of the end-user’s user agent. Therefore, we should explore possibilities (flows) provided by OIDC/OAuth that support this type of access.

One possibility is to make use of the signed-JWT ID Token that can be carried through the calls into and across resource servers. Through the facilities provided by JSON Web Key Set (JWKS), ID Tokens can be verified and trusted by other platforms operating within the same JWKS key hierarchy.

Thus, using the trusted ID Token, it may be possible follow an OIDC/OAuth flow from one EP to another, in which the user is deemed to have a-priori authorised the third-party access. At this point it is only the user’s identity that has been established, with the authorisation decision subject to the rules of the PDP/PEP of the remote system. The identified user must have appropriate a-priori permissions (attributes) on the target resources to be granted access, (ref. ‘Federated Attributes’).

Thus, it is the ID of the user that has been passed machine-to-machine to facilitate the service federation. This effectively achieves cross-EP single sign-on, without relying upon the user agent of the end-user providing cookies to the other EP.

=== Additional OIDC Capabilities

OpenID Connect provides some additional functionalities that are of interest in the context of the Common Architecture.

==== OIDC Discovery

Reference: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html

OpenID Connect makes provision for two types of discovery:

. Discovery of the OpenID Provider Issuer based upon the user’s identifier
. Discovery of the OpenID Provider Configuration Information

In the case of our usage within the Exploitation Platform, type 1) is not application since the user’s ID comes from their ‘Home’ organisation and is not (necessarily) tied to an OpenID Connect Provider. Instead the Login Service must implement a discovery ‘flow’ in which the user is able to select the provider of their identity, as one that is supported by the Login Service deployment.

Regarding discovery type 2), the Login Service exposes an OIDC Provider interface, and this should support retrieval of OIDC Provider Configuration Information. Thus, OIDC Clients can utilise the discovery interface of the Login Service to exploit its services.

This is of most interest in the case of access to federated resources in other EPs, where a resource server in one EP may be acting as an OIDC client of the Login Service in another EP – in which case auto-discovery might be more attractive.

==== Client Registration

Reference: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html

The possibility exists for the OIDC Client (Login Service) to perform auto-registration with the Login Service, using OIDC Client Registration. In doing so the OIDC client obtains its Client ID and Secret.

This may be of interest in a couple of cases:

* The case of access to federated resources in other EPs, where a resource server in one EP may be acting as an OIDC client of the Login Service in another EP – in which case auto-client-registration might be of interest.
* The case where a common Login Service is deployed outside of the context of a given Exploitation Platform, acting as an IdP Proxy. In this case, the local Login Service deployed in each EP would register as an OIDC Client of the IdP Proxy.

=== Authorization (Policy Decision)

TBD

== Accounting and Billing

TBD

== User Profile

The User Profile is a system resource that maintains a set of data for each user including:

* User details
* Terms and conditions accepted by the user
* License keys held by the user
* User API key management

The User Profile for a given user is tied to the unique identifier provided by their Home-IdP through the authentication process.
