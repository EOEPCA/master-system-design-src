= Service API

The Service API presented by the Exploitation Platform is largely defined and met by the fundamental data/processing services it offers. There are some additional meta-services that support the clients in the discovery and usage of these core services. The Service API defined in this section seeks to define a standard set of interfaces against which the Client Library can be developed and that can be relied upon for platform-to-platform interroperability.
